      "Teens use Discord to talk about all sorts of things, ranging from their favorite artists and sports teams to homework and more. It's a home for communities of any size, but it's most widely used by small and active groups of people. These small groups include group chats or other groups, called servers, made by interest-based communities or friend groups. Discord servers are organized into topic-based channels where you can collaborate, share, and just talk about your day without clogging up a group chat. The vast majority of servers are small and invitation-only, so your teen can choose to be a part of servers they want to be in, and if your teen is a server owner, they control who gets to be part of their community.

In text channels, users can post messages, upload files, and share images for others to see at any time. Teens hop into a voice channel and connect through a voice or video call in real time, and can share their screen with their friends.",
